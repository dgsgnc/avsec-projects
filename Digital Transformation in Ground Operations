### Digital Transformation & APIS Deployment in Aviation Operations

Led the operational deployment of **digital aviation solutions**, including the implementation of **Advanced Passenger Information Systems (APIS)**, to replace and optimize traditionally manual, time-consuming processes within ground and security operations.

**Key Actions:**
- Conducted **process mapping** and operational efficiency analysis to identify high-impact digitalization opportunities.
- Collaborated with IT, AVSEC, and ground operations teams to integrate APIS with existing DCS (Departure Control Systems) and security workflows.
- Developed operational **change management plans** and staff training programs for seamless system adoption.

**Achievements:**
- Reduced operational workload and **physical fatigue** among frontline personnel by eliminating redundant manual passenger data checks.
- Enhanced **compliance with international data submission regulations** (ICAO Annex 9 and national AVSEC directives).
- Improved **process turnaround times** and operational efficiency, contributing to a **more productive, resilient, and regulatory-compliant operational framework**.

**Tools & Frameworks:**  
APIS, DCS Integration, Process Mapping, Change Management, AVSEC Compliance
